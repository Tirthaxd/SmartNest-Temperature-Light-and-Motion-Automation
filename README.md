# SmartNest-Temperature-Light-and-Motion-Automation
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a smart home automation system using basic logic gate ic's  
that enhances convenience, energy efficiency, and security by integrating sensor-based control 
for lighting, temperature regulation, and motion detection. This system uses logic circuits with 
sensors to automatically adjust environmental settings, improving overall comfort and reducing 
energy consumption in homes.The verilog implementaion of their logic operations also has been done.
